To set up change details in JDBCOps class for connecting to the DB.

It is VERY important that the databases are named the following;

eventDB
universityDB

This is used for both MySQL scripts and for the program itself!


Then first run createTables.sql
Then run insertData.sql

Now the program should be working as long as the connection details are correct.

JDBC with MySQl version 32 is in the resources folder if necessary you can use that.
